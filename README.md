# CompactVectorSearch: Efficient Vector Search in Small Datasets
![](./media/header.png)
**CompactVectorSearch** is a specialized C# library designed for efficient and precise vector search operations in small datasets. Inspired by the practical approaches discussed in "Vector Search with C#: A Practical Approach for Small Datasets," this project offers a robust solution for those dealing with datasets of fewer than 200 items.

## Key Features:
- **Vector Similarity Measures**: Implements various vector similarity measures like cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and dot product, enabling nuanced and accurate comparisons.
- **Optimized for Small Datasets**: Tailored specifically for small datasets, ensuring high performance and accuracy in environments where conventional large-scale search tools may not be as effective.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive API, making it easy for developers to integrate vector search capabilities into their projects.
- **Versatile Applications**: Ideal for a range of applications, from analyzing code snippets to exploring semantic similarities in small collections of data.
- **C# Implementation**: Fully implemented in C#, offering seamless integration with .NET projects and a familiar environment for C# developers.

## Getting Started:
Check out the documentation for detailed instructions on installation, usage examples, and API reference. Whether you're looking to compare code snippets, explore semantic relationships, or experiment with small-scale vector searches, **CompactVectorSearch** is the go-to resource for efficient and precise vector analysis.
